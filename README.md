# TOP_Landing-page
A  very simple landing page created by following The Odin Project fundamentals section.

It has a very basic design, and a not so good ui, but it was one of the first web designs I did while learning css and html.

Results:

**Note:** Site is responsive, but some elements require more adjustment.
